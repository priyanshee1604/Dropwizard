### üöÄ **What Is Dropwizard?**

Dropwizard helps you build **production-ready** web applications **quickly and easily**.
It‚Äôs like a toolkit that bundles all the **best parts of Java web development** into one clean and ready-to-use package.

It‚Äôs **not a full-blown framework** like Spring, and not just a library either ‚Äî it‚Äôs somewhere in between. The idea is to:

* Make your app **simple to write**
* Make it **fast to launch**
* Make it **easy to maintain**

### ‚öôÔ∏è **What‚Äôs Inside Dropwizard?**

Dropwizard bundles several powerful Java libraries to do all the heavy lifting. Each part has a purpose:

---

### 1. **Jetty ‚Äî Handles HTTP (Web Server)**

* Jetty is a **built-in web server**.
* Unlike traditional Java apps that need an external server like Tomcat or Glassfish, Dropwizard apps **run on their own**.
* You write a `main()` method, and boom ‚Äî your app starts with an HTTP server.

**Benefits:**

* No extra server config
* No crazy deployment steps
* Works well with Linux process tools
* Avoids common Java production issues (like memory leaks, class loader mess, etc.)

---

### 2. **Jersey ‚Äî Builds REST APIs**

* Jersey is the official JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Services) implementation.
* It helps you write **REST APIs** easily using Java classes and annotations.

**Features:**

* Clean mapping of HTTP requests to Java objects
* Supports modern REST features (e.g., conditional GET, streaming, advanced URI features)

---

### 3. **Jackson ‚Äî Handles JSON**

* Jackson is used for **converting Java objects ‚Üî JSON**.
* It‚Äôs **super fast** and **highly customizable**.
* You can directly use your domain models (POJOs) as JSON without much config.

---

### 4. **Metrics ‚Äî For Monitoring**

* Dropwizard includes the **Metrics** library.
* It gives you deep insights into how your app is performing:

  * Response times
  * Memory usage
  * Request rates
  * Error rates

Useful for real-time production monitoring.

### 5. **Other Useful Libraries (The "Friends")**

Here‚Äôs what else is bundled in:

| Library                               | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logback + SLF4J**                   | Flexible and powerful logging                                               |
| **Hibernate Validator (JSR 349)**     | Validates user input with annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`)           |
| **Apache HttpClient + Jersey Client** | Lets your app call other web services (APIs)                                |
| **JDBI**                              | Easy way to talk to relational databases                                    |
| **Liquibase**                         | Keeps your database schema in sync across environments (handles migrations) |
| **Freemarker + Mustache**             | Lightweight templating systems for generating HTML (if needed)              |
