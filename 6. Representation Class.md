## 🧾 What is a Representation Class?

A **representation class** is a simple Java object that represents the **data format** you want to send and receive over your API — in your case, JSON.

This class is sent **from your server to the client** as JSON and vice versa.

The representational class like Saying (used for API responses) typically goes into a package: api

---

## 📦 Your `Saying` Class:

```java
package com.example.helloworld.api;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;

public class Saying {
    private long id;
    private String content;

    public Saying() {
        // Jackson needs this empty constructor to deserialize JSON to Java
    }

    public Saying(long id, String content) {
        this.id = id;
        this.content = content;
    }

    @JsonProperty
    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    @JsonProperty
    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
```

### 🧠 What's Going On Here?

| Code Part                 | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `private long id;`        | Holds the unique ID for the saying                                   |
| `private String content;` | Holds the message (like "Hi!")                                       |
| `public Saying()`         | Default constructor needed by **Jackson** to turn JSON into Java     |
| `public Saying(...)`      | Constructor to easily create objects in code                         |
| `@JsonProperty`           | Tells Jackson to **include this field in JSON** during serialization |

---

### 📤 Example: Serialization

If you do this in Java:

```java
Saying s = new Saying(1, "Hi!");
```

Then Dropwizard (with Jackson) will turn it into:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "content": "Hi!"
}
```

### 🔁 Jackson Makes It Work Both Ways

* Java ➝ JSON (Serialization)
* JSON ➝ Java (Deserialization)

All thanks to:

* JavaBean standard (getters/setters)
* `@JsonProperty` annotations
---

## 🧾 In Dropwizard, the `Saying` class is like a **DTO**.

### ✅ `Saying` = DTO in Spring Boot

* It **represents data** that is sent to/from the client in **JSON** format.
* It **does not interact with the database**.
* It is typically used in **REST API responses or requests**.
* It is **immutable** (just like many DTOs are in Spring Boot for thread safety).
* It is serialized/deserialized by **Jackson**, like DTOs in Spring Boot.


### 🔁 Summary:

| Feature                       | Saying (Dropwizard) | DTO (Spring Boot)   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | 
| Used for API input/output     | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes               |
| Maps to database table        | ❌ No                | ❌ No                | 
| Managed by JPA/Hibernate      | ❌ No                | ❌ No                | 
| Serialized to/from JSON       | ✅ Yes (via Jackson) | ✅ Yes (via Jackson) | 
| Immutable or simple structure | ✅ Usually           | ✅ Usually           |

So in short: **`Saying` in Dropwizard is equivalent to a DTO in Spring Boot**.
